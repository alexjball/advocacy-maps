  const sdrBlurb = `Currently, MA voters must register twenty days before an election
    in order to participate. Removing this barrier, and allowing eligible
    voters to register up to, and on, election day would allow more
    Massachusetts voters to make their voices heard – a critical aspect
    of a healthy democracy. Currently, twenty-two states allow SDR in some
    form. In those states, voter turnout has increased considerably. Demos,
    a non-partisan public policy organization found in a 2009 survey that
    implementing SDR created “minimal” costs, as legislators merely reallocated
    existing resources, and actually reduced the need for provisional ballots –
    saving the time and expense of processing those ballots. Voters registering
    on election day would still be required to provide proof of identity and
    proof of residence, making the process of registration no different from that
    of the current process.`

  const emvTitle = 'No-Excuse Absentee Voting'
  const emvPathMap = '/absentee-voting'
  const emvPathLetter = '/absentee-voting-letter'
  const emvSubHeader = 'Why should we have no-excuse absentee voting?'
  const emvBlurb = `Representative democracy is stronger when more constituents participate in
    elections, and turnout is highest when participation is made easy.
    Massachusetts participation rates in the most recent elections indicate it
    was a success – which stems largely from the emergency acts smartly passed
    by the Legislature in response to COVID-19 (see St.2020 c.115 and St.2020 c.255).
    Among the temporary changes made to our election systems was a relaxing of
    vote-by-mail (absentee ballot) restrictions, allowing individuals from across
    the state to vote early and by absentee ballot. 42% of registered voters in the
    Commonwealth took advantage of the relatively easy means to vote and would likely
    do so again if given the opportunity. Massachusetts should retain these improved
    voting mechanisms.`

  const cfaTitle = 'Publicly Financed Campaigns'
  const cfaPathMap = '/campaign-finance'
  const cfaPathLetter = '/campaign-finance-letter'
  const cfaSubHeader = 'Why should we have publicly funded campaigns?'
  const cfaBlurb = `We urge the elected officials of Massachusetts to reinstitute public funding
    for the elections of qualifying state legislators. Under Common Cause’s
    citizen-funded election proposal, candidates who meet small donor and fundraising
    benchmarks  will receive matching public funding. This additional funding will
    allow individuals without large coffers and wealthy private backers to run
    competitive campaigns. The people of Massachusetts deserve legislators who spend
    less time fundraising and spend more time talking to their constituents and
    passing laws on their behalf. Publicly financed elections level the playing field,
    allowing for broader participation in public office, and ultimately lead to laws
    that better reflect the policy preferences of voters.`
